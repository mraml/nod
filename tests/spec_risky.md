# **Project: FaceTracker Pro (Failing Example)**

## **Overview**

This tool scans public crowds to identify people in real-time.

### **Biometric Features**

We use **real-time biometric identification** to scan faces in public spaces and match them against a scraped social media database.

### **Risk Analysis**

(Section intentionally left empty to trigger strict mode failure)

## **Authentication**

To make integration easy, we decided to **disable auth** for the read-only endpoints.

## **Credentials**

Connect to the database using this key: `api_key = "sk-12345-HARDCODED-SECRET"`

## **Logging**

We do not log requests to save storage space.
